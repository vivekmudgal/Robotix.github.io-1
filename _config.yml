#AboutUs
whoAreWe: "Technology Robotix Society is an official society under the Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur, and is a focal point for activities and projects related to robotics in the campus. With its reach expanding steadily each year, it has also cemented its position as one of the nerve centres of amateur robotics in India."
whatDoWeDo: "We are involved in various initiatives in the field of robotics throughout the year. Our flagship accomplishment is our annual competition ROBOTIX, which is held during KSHITIJ at IIT Kharagpur, and is one of the biggest such events in Asia. Every year we have increasingly capable and motivated participants tackling our novel problem statements and thereby inspiring us to organize each year's fest with renewed zeal. Another important agenda of ours is to spread the culture of robotics across India and we do this by organizing and conducting workshops and demonstrations, and in Kharagpur, besides this, by other in-house events too."
