##### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Build an image processing robot that can recognise useful patterns by pattern
recognition while avoiding other obstacles. The video feed of the arena will 
be given by an overhead camera.

We'll split the Problem Statement into Modules. 

In this tutorial, we'll step by step discuss each module. The first thing to do
is to make a mobile robot capable of moving according to instructions
received from the laptop. 

#### PART 1 - A REMOTE CONTROLLED ROBOT:

##### LOCOMOTION

The robot can be made to move by using a differential drive as the base.
With independent motors for the left and right sides of the base,
differential drives allow the robot to move in all directions and turn as
well. How the motors will rotate will be determined by the voltage supplied
to the motor by the motor driver circuit, which in turn will depend on the
instructions sent to the motor driver by the micro controllers. For more
details on differential drives, please check
[Diffrential drive](/tutorial/mechanical/drivemechtut).

##### MICROCONTROLLER

Conceived to be the brain of the robot, the micro controller is the device
that allows us to control the robot and make it autonomous. By
pre-programming it, we can make it give different outputs based on different
inputs and instructions received, and thereby the robot acts accordingly.
For a more elaborate understanding of the working of an AVR micro controller,
please visit [AVR tutorials](/tutorial/avr/avrprog).
Essentially you only need to program the micro controller on your robot, to
move in a particular direction, based on the character received by it from
the laptop.

#### PART 2 â€“ COMPUTER VISION

Before proceeding with this module, we would request you to go through the
set of general [tutorials](/tutorial/) for computer
vision, for both MATLAB and OpenCV, also found on our website. It is quite
extensive, and we will assume that a working knowledge, as put forward
there, is in the grasp of the reader of this tutorial. 

Note that the video feed will contain some noise. Therefore you will not
have a perfect image, and hence detection may become really difficult or
you might get wrong predictions. Therefore it is advised to use filters to
smoothen your image. 

##### Colour Detection

First thing that needs to be done is that all shapes and obstacles need
to be identified.  We can start with colour detection. Have separate windows
for each colour so that only shapes with the required colours are displayed
in the respective window. 

##### Detecting Contours

We need to scan the shapes present in the arena using an overhead camera.
A good approach to solve this problem would be to segment out the shapes
from the image that is taken by the camera. Use bounding rectangles to take
out the portion of the image containing the shapes. A method called contour
detection can be used to figure out the bounding rectangle. The same thing is 
supposed to be done for the shapes in the given image also. 

##### Template Matching 

After color detection and contour detection, the obtained shapes need to be 
matched with the shapes present in the given image, this can be done using 
template matching.

##### Path Planning

The colour of each shape in the image represents a serial number of that shape.
The serial number corresponding to each colour will be provided at the start of 
the run. The robot has to go to each shape in the ascending order of serial number.
Hence the next step is to figure out the path from current position to the point 
where the corresponding shape is present. There are many path planning algorithms for 
this. One of which is RRT or Randomly Exploring Random Tree. 

**RRT : A Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree** is a randomized data structure that
is designed for path planning problems. 

In any image where RRT has to be implemented, there will be  a start point,
an end point and obstacles. The start point is taken as the first node, and
the end point is taken as the last node. The first step is to generate a
random node. Using distance formula, the node (in the tree) which has the
minimum distance from this random node among all other nodes in the tree is
identified. /tarting from the nearest node, in the direction of the random
node, a new node is generated at a predefined distance called step size.
This new node is then added to the tree. These steps are repeated n number
of times till the end point is added to the tree. Then a continuous path is
traced from the start point to the end point which successfully avoids all
obstacles. This process results into a tree-like structure, hence the name
Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree. 

However, participants are free to use any path planning algorithm they are
comfortable with. 

##### Tracking the Position of the Robot

Throughout your run you will require to track the position of the robot.
A marker for the same will be provided. The marker will consist of two
squares with different colours. RGB values of the colours will be provided.
First we need to scan the input image to get all the points whose colour is
roughly the same as the colour of square 1/Head. The centre of all these
points is the centre of the Head. Similarly we can find the centre of the
Tail. The geometric midpoint of these centre can be fairly estimated as the
Position of the Robot.

##### Locomotion of the Robot

Now that we know the position of the bot and the position of every
subsequent shape, we need to send commands to the robot so that it moves to
that particular position. Since all the readings are not accurate with the
help of overhead camera we just need to move the robot so that its distance
with respect to the subsequent position is less than a certain threshold.
