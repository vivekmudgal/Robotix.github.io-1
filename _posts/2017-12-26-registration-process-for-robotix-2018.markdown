#### Registration for ROBOTIX 2018 are now open.

For all the event details of Robotix 2018, visit: [Robotix 2018 - Events](https://2018.robotix.in/event/).

**Note:** All Team members are required to register at the Kshitij website before team formation. One of the
team members should act as captain and invite all other members to his team from the _Invitations_ section as
explained below. The other members should accept the invitation to join the team from their own Kshitij accounts.
Only the captain can dismantle the entire team while individual members may leave the team anytime. The captain
is also known as the _leader_ at some places.

##### For Registrations:

 * Visit Kshitij website: [http://www.ktj.in/](http://www.ktj.in)

 * Register on the website by clicking _SIGNUP_ at the bottom of the home page after entering the site.

 * Locate the register option on the right. A registration link appears at the centre. Clicking that link completes your registration for that event.

 * Now you have to form a team. For this select the option _MYKTJ_ at the homescreen and select the event among the dropdown list.

 * After selecting the event, enter the e-mail ids of your team members. You should leave the last option of fourth member empty. Send the invitation by clicking the required button.

 **Note**: You can only select a teammate after he/she has registered on the KTJ site. You will find the name
 of the person in the drop box list. You cannot use a find feature here and you will have to do this manually.

 * Now your teammate has to accept the request. Ask your teammate to go to his _MYKTJ_ page and click on _PENDING INVITATIONS_ tab.
 This will appear.

 * After the teammate accepts the request, both the _leader_ ie. the one who registered for the event and the _members_ can see the team on their respective _MYKTJ_ page in the _MY TEAM MEMBER LIST_ tab.
